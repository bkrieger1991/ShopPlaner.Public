## About 
Here you can create your shopping lists, manage prices and save individual templates like recipes.<br/>
As the sole developer, I, Benni, have created this app to make shopping easier for you.<br/>
With ShopPlanner you can keep track of your weekly purchases and the costs associated with them.<br/>
<br/>
I hope ShopPlanner will help you optimize your shopping planning and make shopping less stressful.<br/>
<br/>
Best regards,<br/>
